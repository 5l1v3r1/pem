Backward Compatibility
======================

``pem`` has a very strong backward compatibility policy that is inspired by the one of the `Twisted framework <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>`_.

Put simply, you shouldn't ever be afraid to upgrade ``pem`` if you're using its public APIs.
If there will ever be need to break compatibility, it will be announced in the :doc:`changelog`, raise deprecation warning for a year before it's finally really broken.
